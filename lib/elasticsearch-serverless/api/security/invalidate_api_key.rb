        # Invalidates one or more API keys.
        # The +manage_api_key+ privilege allows deleting any API keys.
        # The +manage_own_api_key+ only allows deleting API keys that are owned by the user.
        # In addition, with the +manage_own_api_key+ privilege, an invalidation request must be issued in one of the three formats:
        # - Set the parameter +owner=true+.
        # - Or, set both +username+ and +realm_name+ to match the userâ€™s identity.
        # - Or, if the request is issued by an API key, i.e. an API key invalidates itself, specify its ID in the +ids+ field.
