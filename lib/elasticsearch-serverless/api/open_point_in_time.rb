      # A search request by default executes against the most recent visible data of the target indices,
      # which is called point in time. Elasticsearch pit (point in time) is a lightweight view into the
      # state of the data as it existed when initiated. In some cases, itâ€™s preferred to perform multiple
      # search requests using the same point in time. For example, if refreshes happen between
      # +search_after+ requests, then the results of those requests might not be consistent as changes happening
      # between searches are only visible to the more recent point in time.
      #
      # @option arguments [String, Array] :index A comma-separated list of index names to open point in time; use +_all+ or empty string to perform the operation on all indices (*Required*)
      # @option arguments [Time] :keep_alive Extends the time to live of the corresponding point in time. (*Required*)
      # @option arguments [Boolean] :ignore_unavailable If +false+, the request returns an error if it targets a missing or closed index.
      # @option arguments [String] :preference Specifies the node or shard the operation should be performed on. Random by default.
      # @option arguments [String] :routing Custom value used to route operations to a specific shard.
      # @option arguments [String, Array<String>] :expand_wildcards Type of index that wildcard patterns can match. If the request can target data streams, this argument determines whether wildcard expressions match hidden data streams. Supports comma-separated values, such as +open,hidden+. Valid values are: +all+, +open+, +closed+, +hidden+, +none+. Server default: open.
      # @option arguments [Hash] :headers Custom HTTP headers
      #
