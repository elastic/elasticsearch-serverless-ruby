This page guides you through the installation process of the Serverless Ruby 
client, shows you how to instantiate the client, and how to perform basic 
Elasticsearch operations with it.


## Requirements

* Ruby 3.0 or higher installed on your system.
* You must use the Elastiscearch Serverless service to use the 
`elasticsearch-serverless` gem.


## Installation


### Using the command line

You can install the Elasticsearch Serverless Ruby client with the following 
commands:

```bash
# From the project's root directory:
$ gem build elasticsearch-serverless.gemspec
$ gem install elasticsearch-serverless-x.x.x.gem
```


### Using the Gemfile

Or include the client gem in your Ruby project's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'elasticsearch-serverless', path: '../path/to/client-code'
```


### Adding a Ruby console

Additionally, you can have a Ruby console with the required librares to use the 
client by using a rake task:

```bash
$ bundle exec rake console
```

## Instantiate a client

You can instantiate a client by running the following command:

```ruby
client = ElasticsearchServerless::Client.new(
  api_key: 'your_api_key',
  url: 'https://my-deployment-url'
)
```

You can find the Elasticsearch endpoint on the Cloud deployment management page.

You can create a new API Key under **Stack Management** > **Security**:

## Using the API

After you instantiated a client with your API key and Elasticsearch endpoint, 
you can start ingesting documents into the Elasticsearch Service. You can use 
the Bulk API for this. This API enables you to index, update, and delete several 
documents in one request.

You can call the `bulk` API with a body parameter, an array of hashes that 
define the action, and a document. 

The following is an example of indexing some classic books into the `books` 
index:
